In the industry, you should **not** implement your own authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-User](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/9nVfotMI_1zpEzihMzBeTA "Flask-User")). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

Resources
---------

**Read or watch:**

*   [Flask documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/lKExyvivrrW4eh0eI8UV6A "Flask documentation")
*   [Requests module](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/py7LuuD1u2MUwcaf8wnDzQ "Requests module")
*   [HTTP status codes](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/cj-mc5ZHp_KyXn1yikHC0A "HTTP status codes")

Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/oAqmZmipBdjCcfI5QqyFXA "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

*   How to declare API routes in a Flask app
*   How to get and set cookies
*   How to retrieve request form data
*   How to return various HTTP status codes

Requirements
------------

*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
*   All your files should end with a new line
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
*   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
*   Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
*   You should use `SQLAlchemy` 1.3.x
*   All your files must be executable
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
*   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
*   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
*   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
*   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
*   All your functions should be type annotated
*   The flask app should only interact with `Auth` and never with `DB` directly.
*   Only public methods of `Auth` and `DB` should be used outside these classes

Setup
-----

You will need to install `bcrypt`

    pip3 install bcrypt
